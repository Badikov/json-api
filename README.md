A simple set of JSON RESTful endpoints using the repository pattern.

This app lives at [json-api.rocks](http://json-api.rocks) and responds to requests at `/api/movies`.

See the post [here](http://commandercoriander.net/blog/2014/01/04/test-driving-a-json-api-in-rails/) for an introduction to how this app's API was written.

The post [here](http://commandercoriander.net/blog/2014/01/11/curling-with-rails/) shows how to practice using `curl` with this app.

See [here](https://github.com/enocom/angular_client) for an AngularJS client and [here](https://github.com/enocom/react_client) for a ReactJS client.
